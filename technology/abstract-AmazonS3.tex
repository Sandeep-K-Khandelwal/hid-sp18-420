\section{Amazon S3}

Amazon's S3 is a simple storage service which mainly focuses on a
highly-scalable, reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at low
costs~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-S3-FAQ}. S3 is nothing but a web service
provided by Amazon that can be used to store and retrieve data. It can be used
for static website hosting. It is available at any point of time and can be used
to store virtually any kind of data in any format and one of the important
features of using S3 is that it offers a highly durable, scalable, and secure
destination for backing up and archiving critical
data~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-S3}. S3 provides versioning capability to provide
even further protection for stored data. It is easy to define lifecycle rules to
automatically migrate less frequently accessed data. S3 also allows static web
hosting for different web applications~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-S3}.
