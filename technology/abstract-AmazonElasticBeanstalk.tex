\section{Amazon Elastic Beanstalk}

AWS Elastic Beanstalk~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-elastic-beanstalk} is a managed
service used for application deployment and management. Using EBS it is easy to
quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud. Developers simply
upload their application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the
deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and
application health monitoring~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-elastic-beanstalk_faq}.
Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Java, PHP, .NET, Node.js,
Python, and Ruby, as well as different container types for each language and a
container defines the infrastructure and software stack to be used for a given
environment~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-elastic-beanstalk_faq}.
