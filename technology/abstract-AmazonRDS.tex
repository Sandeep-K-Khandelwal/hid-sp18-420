\section{Amazon RDS}

Amazon RDS is a Relational Database. It is a managed service and easy to set up,
operate, and scale a relational database. RDS is cost effective and has capacity
to resize as per requirement. It manages time-consuming database administration
tasks~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-RDS-FAQ}. Amazon RDS gives access to MySQL,
MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL database. Amazon RDS can
automatically backup your database and keep your database software up to date
with the latest version. Amazon RDS makes it easy to use replication to enhance
database availability, improve data durability, or scale beyond the capacity
constraints of a single database instance for read-heavy database
workloads~\cite{hid-sp18-420-amazon-RDS-FAQ}.
